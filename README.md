DECAMsin
=====
``DECAMsim`` is a python package providing tools to simulate DECAM data. It provides
simulated catalog of stars for a given number of observations. The simulated catalogs
contain stars with g band magnitude between 14 and 20 and stellar type of G0 to G9,
F0 to F9, K0 to K9 and M0 to M9. In addition to WCS coordinates of the stars, a generated
catalog includes the pixel coordinates on the CCDs. The following magnitudes are also
generated:

DES magnitudes: u g r i z

Gaia magnitudes: G BP RP RVS

CFHT magnitude: u g r i z
